# TaskStack

### a simple stack-based task management system for people who keep getting distracted

(Windows-only, sorry)

Hotkeys:
 * Pause/Break: open interface (global system hotkey)
 * Tilde: pop task off of stack
 * Escape: close interface

Wanna change the hotkeys? Too bad! I just made this for myself and i'm lazy so if you wanna change the hotkeys you'll need to change the source and build it yourself.
